Lori-Ann
1)	When you login it doesn’t look like it. The logout button appears but the sign up for facebook icon is still at the top.
2)	Report/contact button doesn’t work.
3)	 Needs instructions or about page.  Otherwise user doesn’t know what it’s supposed to do or how.
4)	When you check out users- the  edit and destroy buttons are on TOP of user info.
5)	Needs a save button not just edit and destroy.
6)	 Teachers can join classes
7)	No differentiation between teachers and students in login. All can access everything.  Restrict access
8)	 No way to take the tests or quizzes.  Teachers can’t even add a link to the quiz or attach a file to download.
9)	Quizzes empty. Only names of them.
10)	Users see questions but no place to enter the data.
11)	Facebook is too public and their privacy problems would cause problems for districts, states and federal   student privacy laws.
12)	 No purpose to grade levels- classes can’t be added to them, no content in them.  NADA.
13)	 If a user likes the app- the link from facebook page is not useable.
14)	No district is going to accept the ability to share their school login page, assignments and list of students  to anyone who  clicks on the link that is shared freely. No login needed besides being a facebook  member.  (link on anothers page doesn’t work)
15)	 Due dates not in a standard format.  Needs to be USA standard.
16)	The  2nd day  end slots  go from 00-23 and need to go from (none) to 31 as the days in a month.
17)	The last drop down on this page isn’t time or hour. No idea what it stands for- and it doesn’t show up in the listed assignment anyway.
18)	If it is hour  what is hour 59 I ask of you? 0-59
19)	It’s pointless to be able to  go back to 2007 for assignments due.
20)	It should autofill to the current year and date and changeable from there.
21)	 On  a mac the link to the app says only “Something went wrong” in red, even after login. (when the user pastes in address of app) firefox and safari and on XP.
22)	When you logout on the PC it says We're sorry, but something went wrong.” And user is still logged in to facebook it seems but as soon as they try.
23)	Link also doesn’t work once logged off of the app.  On PC 7 
24)	 Link doesn’t work on a mac when liked either.
25)	After first click from the email sent to get to the app. Reclicking on it doesn’t work ‘something went wrong’ is all you get.
26)	User can delete all users creating the above error. Shouldn’t be possible. Then users are no longer authenticated…
27)	Needs an admin account.
28)	In quizzes it needs to force you to have a correct answer.

1. Login incorrectly 3 times to get error page. Web page not expandable to see the entire message.
